## Meal & Insulin Log product brief, value 1: sign-in and per-user data

### Purpose
Stand up the static web app shell and the Supabase identity boundary so that a person signs in with email and password and reads and writes only their own rows, and a second account sees none of the first account's rows.

### Constraints
- The front end is a static bundle only; GitHub Pages serves prebuilt files and there is no server process to operate.
- The backend is Supabase on its free tier: Postgres for data, Supabase Auth for email and password identity, and the browser calling Supabase directly with the JS client.
- Schema and row-level security live in the repository as SQL migrations run by the Supabase CLI; tests run against the CLI's local Docker stack, not a hosted project.
- Only the Supabase project URL and the anon key may reach the browser bundle; the service-role key never leaves the developer machine and never appears in the repository.
- Row-level security is deny by default: every user table has it enabled and every policy is scoped to the owning account.
- The layout is fluid with no fixed page width and no horizontal scrolling at any viewport width from 360 px upward.
- Light and dark palettes come from the canvas design reference and follow the device setting.
- The app never recommends a dose.

### Targets
| Path | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json` | CREATE_NEW | The repository has no Node manifest; the build, the Supabase client dependency and the verification scripts need one. |
| `tsconfig.json` | CREATE_NEW | TypeScript is the source language, so the compiler needs strict settings the build and the tests share. |
| `vite.config.ts` | CREATE_NEW | Vite produces the static bundle GitHub Pages serves and resolves the base path for a project page. |
| `index.html` | CREATE_NEW | The single page the static host serves; it carries the viewport meta that makes the layout fluid. |
| `src/main.ts` | CREATE_NEW | The composition root that reads the session and renders either the sign-in screen or the signed-in shell. |
| `src/ports/identity.ts` | CREATE_NEW | The driving port for sign-in, sign-out and current account, so the domain compiles without the Supabase SDK. |
| `src/ports/log-store.ts` | CREATE_NEW | The driven port for owner-scoped reads and writes, so later values extend one boundary rather than calling Supabase from screens. |
| `src/adapters/supabase/client.ts` | CREATE_NEW | Builds the single Supabase JS client from build-time public configuration. |
| `src/adapters/supabase/identity.ts` | CREATE_NEW | Implements the identity port against Supabase Auth and maps its errors onto the named failure outcomes. |
| `src/ui/sign-in.ts` | CREATE_NEW | The sign-in screen: a labelled email and password form with the refusal and retry messages. |
| `src/ui/shell.ts` | CREATE_NEW | The signed-in frame with the bottom navigation the later screens mount into. |
| `src/ui/theme.css` | CREATE_NEW | The light and dark palette tokens taken from the canvas reference, selected by the device colour-scheme setting. |
| `supabase/config.toml` | CREATE_NEW | Pins the local Supabase stack the acceptance run starts with the CLI. |
| `supabase/migrations/0001_owner_scoped_schema.sql` | CREATE_NEW | Creates the owner-scoped tables, enables row-level security and adds the policies the oracle falsifies. |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | CREATE_NEW | Builds the bundle and publishes it to GitHub Pages, which is how the URL in the observation comes to exist. |
| `tests/acceptance/own-data-only.spec.ts` | CREATE_NEW | The public oracle for this value, driving the served bundle in a browser as two separate accounts. |
| `tests/support/local-stack.ts` | CREATE_NEW | Starts the local Supabase stack, applies migrations and hands the test its URL and anon key. |
| `tests/support/accounts.ts` | CREATE_NEW | Creates the two test accounts and seeds account A's rows through the service role, outside the browser. |

### Paradigm
functional

### Decisions
- Build with Vite and TypeScript; the artefact is a static bundle in dist/ that any static host, GitHub Pages included, serves unchanged.
- No UI framework. A screen is a pure function from state to a DOM subtree, so every rule this product is judged on stays testable without a renderer.
- The Supabase JS client v2 is the only data access path. There is no custom server and no API layer of our own.
- The Supabase project URL and anon key are build-time public configuration injected as Vite environment variables; both are safe to publish because row-level security, not key secrecy, is what separates the two accounts.
- Every user table carries user_id uuid not null default auth.uid() references auth.users(id) on delete cascade, has row-level security enabled, and has policies using (auth.uid() = user_id) for select, update and delete and with check (auth.uid() = user_id) for insert.
- Ownership is enforced in Postgres, never in the browser. The client never filters by user_id; if a policy were removed the oracle would fail rather than a client-side filter hiding it.
- The Supabase client's own persisted session is the session. The app renders the sign-in screen when there is none and the shell when there is, and re-renders on the auth state change event.
- Acceptance runs against the Supabase CLI local stack in Docker with two seeded accounts, so the oracle exercises real Postgres and real row-level security rather than a stub.
- The oracle drives the built bundle served as static files, because a live GitHub Pages URL is not a locally falsifiable observation; the Pages workflow publishes that same bundle.

### Reuse analysis
| Symbol | Locator | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|

### Prefactoring
Not applicable: The repository holds no source code yet, so there is no existing structure to move before this change.

### Agreement analysis
Not applicable: No contract exists yet between separately released parts. This value introduces the database schema and its only consumer together in one candidate, so nothing can be left behind on an older agreement.

### Boundaries
- Driving port: A person acting through a phone browser: open the site, submit email and password, then read and write their own log.
- Driven port: Supabase Auth over HTTPS for email and password sign-in, sign-out and session refresh.
- Driven port: Supabase PostgREST over HTTPS for owner-scoped row reads and writes under row-level security.
- Driven port: The browser's persistent storage, which holds the Supabase session between visits.
- Dependency direction: The screens and the domain depend on the identity and log-store port interfaces; the Supabase adapters depend on those interfaces. Nothing under src/ports or src/domain imports the Supabase SDK, so the rules compile and run without a network.
- Failure: Condition: Supabase Auth rejects the submitted email and password. | Outcome: Refusal | Observation: The sign-in screen stays, shows 'Email or password is not correct', no session is stored, and the password field is cleared.
- Failure: Condition: The network is unreachable while sign-in is being submitted. | Outcome: Retry | Observation: The sign-in screen shows 'Cannot reach the server. Try again.' and the submit button becomes usable again with the email still filled in.
- Failure: Condition: A read asks for a row owned by another account. | Outcome: Refusal | Observation: Row-level security returns no row. The screen shows its empty state and never shows another account's data.
- Failure: Condition: The stored session has expired and refreshing it fails. | Outcome: Refusal | Observation: The app returns to the sign-in screen showing 'Your session ended. Sign in again.' and the stale session is cleared.
- Failure: Condition: A write is sent and the response is lost before it arrives, so the browser cannot tell whether Postgres committed it. | Outcome: Indeterminate | Observation: The screen says 'Could not confirm the save. Check the entry before saving again.' and does not silently retry, because a duplicated meal would corrupt the comparison this product exists for.

### Acceptance supports
- `supabase/migrations/0001_owner_scoped_schema.sql`
- `tests/support/local-stack.ts`
- `tests/support/accounts.ts`

### Public oracle
Observation: A person opens the site on a phone, signs in with email and password, and sees only their own data; a second account sees none of the first account's rows.

Stimulus: Two accounts exist in the local Supabase stack, and account A already owns rows in every user table. A browser at a phone viewport loads the built static bundle, signs in as account A, signs out, then signs in as account B on the same bundle.

Expected: Account A signs in and its own rows are on screen. Account B signs in and sees the empty state, with none of account A's rows present, at every table the app reads. Neither sign-in fails.

Falsifier: Account B sees any row owned by account A, or account A sees none of its own rows, or either account cannot sign in with correct credentials, or the page scrolls horizontally at a 360 px viewport.
